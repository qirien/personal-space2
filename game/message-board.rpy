# Community: Miners moving to mountain near luddites! If your relationship with both parties is good, you can coordinate and avoid accident. Otherwise bad things can happen (mining stops and you lose your status as RET liason, you scare off the luddites and zero your relationship with them, or you encourage them to stay and Travis loses his leg). This is the second ‚Äúsave the cave‚Äù incident; modify the earlier one to be about something other than a cave.

# Community: Growing luxury good market, especially if mining stopped in 22. The increased demand for shells led to inflation and Ilian fixes the prices of food. You can choose to write a farming guide, which Oleg makes free, babysit (most lucrative and stressful), or be a farming consultant.

# Community: You can choose to tell colonists that Pete‚Äôs beef contains cancer cells.
# There‚Äôs also discussion about how to help a heavy user of firegrass, Carol. Depending on certain values, you can convince Brennan to prevent miners from working too long of hours or grow more tea or nothing. No matter what you choose, Oleg makes an educational app (he or one of his friends has a side-business of their own firegrass dealings).
# ALSO in this long event, a shuttle arrives with material to start an artificial meat plant. You can choose to keep buying meat from Pete or not.
# Family: Talking politics? Terra thinks you're a terrible leader. Either you're too strict, treating one group badly (miners? Jellies?), Or you are clueless and you don't even know what people are doing behind your back.

# Community: Reckoning with jellypeople. There are several ways to fail the jellypeople. If you agree to help them, you can either farm mudfish or one of their predators, a fish called a Shill. You can also choose to tell Brennan about possible heavy metals in the mud. Miranda reveals that she and Dr. Lily taught the jellysquid how to ‚Äúread‚Äù.
# Family: Terra wants a bike!

# Community: Mayor Grayson dies--you can choose to approve of euthanasia or not, which he requests after realizing he suffers from dementia. Also, you can vote for if miners should be allowed to vote for a new mayor. Your relationship values, not your vote, determines this outcome. Higher miner values means that the colonists vote for them to be able to vote, and they elect Kevin. Otherwise the colonists vote NOT to let them vote, and elect Julia.
# Family: Plans for future

# Community: brainstorming: Pete is desperate for more credits after Helen has a high-risk pregnancy. No one is buying fireweed from him anymore‚Ä¶ because he‚Äôs being undersold by Julia. [If you told Brennan about the heavy metals in the mud, he‚Äôs now mining there and making the water silty--so jellysquid no longer appear in the area. Otherwise maybe the jellypeople are helping you, or nothing.]
