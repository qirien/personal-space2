    "baby": "My world is small -- my family, blanket, and milk. So when something goes wrong it's like my whole world is collapsing! That's why I cry so much. \n\nI am learning so much every day, but it probably seems slow to you. I'm learning to focus my vision, touch and grab things, make sounds and decode their meaning, and who I can trust to take care of me. Soon I'll even move my whole body and understand a little of what you are saying, and make sounds that mean things. \n\nPlease be patient with me and show me a lot of love; I'm learning as fast as I can!",

    "toddler": "Now that I'm crawling and walking, my world is so much bigger! There's new foods, new faces, and new sensations every day. All this stuff is old to you, but to me it's all new -- the sound of a spoon on a pot, or the touch of sand, or the funny look on your face when I blow a raspberry. \n\nI want to do things myself but I am still clumsy and learning, so please help me explore safely and teach me even when it takes a long time for me to learn. I don't understand water, fire, electricity, or poison so help me be safe from these dangerous things while letting me explore as much as possible!",

    "preschooler": "I am learning how to do even cooler things! I can hop on one foot and name colors and sort toys! I have a great imagination and can benefit from playing with other kids and talking to lots of different people. I am still learning about politeness and what behavior is okay for different situations. \n\nI love rules because then I know what to do, but I get mad if other people don't follow them! Sometimes I think I can do things I can't really do yet, so help me improve my skills while still watching me. I am learning how to decide some things for myself, so please help me learn to make good choices by letting me decide some things!",

    "child": "I can do a lot of things that you can do! I can learn complex skills like doing math, playing sports, and making crafts. I am starting to think more about other people and what will happen in the future, but I'm not very good at it yet. Friends are important to me, but sometimes I don't get along with other people, so help me learn how to be a good friend and fix my mistakes. \n\nPlease support my growing independence by letting me do things for myself and giving me responsibilities!",

    "tween": "I am starting to think more abstractly. I am learning not just about what the world is, but why it is the way it is. When I was little, I thought I was the best person ever, but now I'm starting to see that I'm not. Please help me to recognize my strengths and deal with my weaknesses. \n\nWhat my friends think is becoming more important, but I still want to hear what you have to say. I might argue with you, but please be patient and love me and I'll think about what you say. My body is changing a lot now, too, and I'm starting to wonder what kind of person I want to be.",

    "yteen": "I might be rude to you and push you away when you try to show me affection like you did when I was a kid. I don't want you to tell me what to do. I will probably make some stupid choices and be hard on myself. Usually I don't need you to rescue me, but I need you to support and love me no matter what. \n\nI need to separate myself from you as I'm learning independence, so my words, appearance, music, and friends might seem really strange! \n\nPlease be interested in me and my world without trying to rule over it, and keep loving me and setting limits to protect me while I'm learning.",

    "teen": "I often have difficult questions, and I don't want easy answers. I am really thinking about these things and looking at a lot of different perspectives. If you listen to me, I will show you the same respect and hear what you have to say. If you are rude or try to tell me what to do, I will go somewhere else for answers. I want to find things out for myself. \n\nI'm learning about how to love and be a good friend and be on my own, and a lot of my emotions are still very strong. Please recognize my feelings and help me prepare to live on my own."

    "\"It is essential that a child's life not be ruled by the adult's need for efficiency. Efficiency is the enemy of infancy.\"\n\nHaim G. Ginott, {i}Between Parent and Child{/i}", #2
    "\"Effective parenting centers around love: love that is not permissive, love that doesn‚Äôt tolerate disrespect, but also love that is powerful enough to allow kids to make mistakes and permit them to live with the consequences of those mistakes.\"\n\nFoster W. Cline, {i}Parenting with Love and Logic{/i}", #3
    "\"It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.\"\n\n -- Frederick Douglass", #4

    "\"When a parent is not sure of what to do, it is best to do nothing but think and clarify his own attitudes.\"\n\nHaim G. Ginott, {i}Between Parent and Child{/i}", #6
    "\"Children are educated by what the grown-up is and not by his talk.\"\n\n -- Carl Jung", #7
    "\"At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a child's success is the positive involvement of parents.\"\n\nJane D. Hull", #8
    "\"Research has shown that the most effective way to reduce problem behavior in children is to strengthen desirable behavior through positive reinforcement rather than trying to weaken undesirable behavior using aversive or negative processes.\"\n\nS.W. Bijou, {i}The International Encyclopedia of Education{/i}", #9
    "\"Love is expressed in how we pass the bread, or how we say good morning, and not just in the big trip to Disney World.\"\n\nMyla and John Kabat-Zinn, {i}Everyday Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting{/i}", #10
    "\"...communication with children is based on respect and on skill. It requires (a) that messages preserve the child's as well as the parent's self-respect; (b) that statements of understanding precede statements of advice and instruction.\"\n\nHaim G. Ginott, {i}Between Parent and Child{/i}", #11
    "\"The right age to inform a child about sexual matters is when he asks questions‚Ä¶.Our explanation should be factual but it does not need to give full account.\"\n\nHaim G. Ginott, {i}Between Parent and Child{/i}", #12
    "\"Misbehavior of children must be recognized as a need to teach appropriate behavior, not an excuse to punish. Punishment is a terrible teacher. It only teaches children how not to behave.\"\n\nGlenn Latham, {i}The Power of Positive Parenting{/i}", #13
    "\"We often rob children of opportunities to feel belonging and significance in meaningful ways through responsible contributions and then complain and criticize them for not developing responsibility. We need to provide opportunities for children to experience responsibility in direct relationship to the privileges they enjoy.\"\n\nJane Nelson, {i}Positive Discipline{/i}", #14

    "\"Perhaps parenting styles are less important than people have been led to believe. Perhaps human nature is more robust than most people give it credit for ‚Äî perhaps children are designed to resist whatever their parents do to them.\"\n\nJudith Rich Harris, \"Parenting Styles Have Changed But Children Have Not\"", #18
    "\"The best solution to any problem lies within the skin of the person who rightfully owns the problem.\"\n\nFoster W. Cline, {i}Parenting with Love and Logic{/i}", #19
    "\"A limit should be so stated that it tells the child clearly (a) what constitutes unacceptable conduct; (b) what substitute will be accepted‚Ä¶. A limit must be stated in a manner that is deliberately calculated to minimize resentment , and to save self-esteem. The very process of limit-setting should convey authority, not insult.\"\n\nHaim G. Ginott, {i}Between Parent and Child{/i}", #20

    "\"When children and adolescents who are in need of differentiating themselves from their caregivers engender hate in those caregivers, it is because they simultaneously need to be separate and need to stay attached.

    "\"There is a cognitive bias that makes people overestimate their own importance and their own ability to influence how things turn out - not just in child-rearing but in everything they do.\"\n\n -- Judith R. Harris", #27
