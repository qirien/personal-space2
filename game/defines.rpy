I am still learning about politeness and what behavior is okay for different situations. \n\nI love rules because then I know what to do, but I get mad if other people don't follow them! Sometimes I think I can do things I can't really do yet, so help me improve my skills while still watching me. I am learning how to decide some things for myself, so please help me learn to make good choices by letting me decide some things!",

        "child": "I can do a lot of things that you can do! I can learn complex skills like doing math, playing sports, and making crafts. I am starting to think more about other people and what will happen in the future, but I'm not very good at it yet. Friends are important to me, but sometimes I don't get along with other people, so help me learn how to be a good friend and fix my mistakes. \n\nPlease support my growing independence by letting me do things for myself and giving me responsibilities!",

        "tween": "I am starting to think more abstractly. I am learning not just about what the world is, but why it is the way it is. When I was little, I thought I was the best person ever, but now I'm starting to see that I'm not. Please help me to recognize my strengths and deal with my weaknesses. \n\nWhat my friends think is becoming more important, but I still want to hear what you have to say. I might argue with you, but please be patient and love me and I'll think about what you say. My body is changing a lot now, too, and I'm starting to wonder what kind of person I want to be.",

        "yteen": "I might be rude to you and push you away sometimes, and I don't want you to tell me what to do. I will probably make some stupid choices and be hard on myself. Try not to solve my problems for me, but support and love me no matter what. \n\nI need to separate myself from you as I'm learning independence, so my words, appearance, music, and friends might seem really strange! \n\nPlease be interested in me and my world without trying to rule over it, and keep loving me and setting limits to protect me while I'm learning.",

        "teen": "I often have difficult questions, and I don't want easy answers. I am really thinking about these things and looking at a lot of different perspectives. If you listen to me, I will show you the same respect and hear what you have to say. If you are rude or try to tell me what to do, I will go somewhere else for answers. I want to find things out for myself. \n\nI'm learning about how to love and be a good friend and be on my own, and a lot of my emotions are still very strong. Please acknowledge my point of view and help me prepare to live on my own."
